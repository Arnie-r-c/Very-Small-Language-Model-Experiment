This very small language model consists of only three parameters- frequency, and two context tokens. it's not very good, nor is it complex, but that is the point; it's a learning tool to better understand language processing. it can string together "almost meaningful" lines of text based on its training data, which is whatever you want it to be. I included a text file of DRM-free books from Gutenberg that you can use to test it out, but I recommend experimenting with different training data. DRM-free books from sites like Gutenberg are a good place to start, but the tokenizer can parse any UTF8 alphanumeric text file.
It takes in text files (.txt) and tokenizes them using the tokenizer option, then outputs them to a CSV. The tokenizer will leave the data mostly clean, or at least clean enough for the model to train on it. the model ignores punctuation and only uses spaces and alphanumeric chars, so it's not very picky about its training data.
to run the model, the CSV must be named "csv.csv," so whatever you decide to name it in the tokenizer, rename it to csv.csv in the program directory. there will be a brief pause depending on how fast your system is as the model "learns" the training data, the more training data you provide, the better the model will be, but training will also take longer, so don't be alarmed if it hangs after you select the model from the menu, give it time. the next menu under the model will give you three options- next-word prediction, long-form generation, and prompt mode.

generation mode will ask for two seed tokens and a number of tokens to generate. it will then generate the requested tokens, starting from the seed tokens.
prompt mode is more familiar if you've used models like GPT. you type a prompt and the model attempts to continue where you left off.
 for each of these modes, you will have to enter two tokens or words that appear in the training data. any random word won't do, as the model cannot understand words that don't appear in its training data. after the seed words are entered, it will reply.
at this time, it only has a two-token context, and I don't plan on improving this project in the immediate future. Instead, I will make a more ambitious project.

make sure all training files, including the Txt file and the CSV, are in the project folder, or it won't work.

Here is some example output based on the training data I provide with this repo:
